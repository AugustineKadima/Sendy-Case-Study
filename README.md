# Sendy-Case-Study

This is a project that entails performing data analysis on data provided by Sendy in order to:

* Analyse the order cancellations and visualize the most important aspects. 
 
* Recommend how to reduce the number of cancelled orders.

* Predict the cancellation reason for all orders with missing data in the second dataset.

## Description
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis to study the different factors affect cancellation reasons.

This project also entails building of a KNN model in order to predict cancellation reasons for orders.

## Usage
Depending on the different factors provided, the model is built to predict the cancellation reasons for different orders.

## Installation
Install Python and it's libraries in order to understand this project and use the models.

## Contributing
This Project was done by Cherono Kibet.
